# Добро пожаловать на аудиокурс Hugging Face!

Уважаемый слушатель,

Добро пожаловать в этот курс по использованию трансформеров в аудио. Трансформеры снова и снова доказывают, что они являются одной из
наиболее мощных и универсальных архитектур глубокого обучения, способных достигать передовых результатов в широком спектре
задач, включая обработку естественного языка, компьютерное зрение, а с недавних пор и аудио p0

В этом курсе мы рассмотрим, как трансформеры могут быть применены к аудиоданным. Вы узнаете, как использовать их для решения
ряда задач, связанных с аудио. Если вас интересует распознавание речи, классификация аудиоданных или генерация речи
из текста, трансформеры и данный курс помогут вам в этом.

Чтобы вы могли оценить возможности этих моделей, произнесите несколько слов в демонстрации ниже и посмотрите, как модель транскрибирует их в режиме реального времени!

В ходе курса вы получите представление о специфике работы с аудиоданными, узнаете о различных 
архитектурах трансформеров, а также обучите свои собственные аудио трансформеры, используя мощные предварительно обученные модели.

Этот курс рассчитан на слушателей, имеющих опыт глубокого обучения и общее представление о трансформерах.
Знаний в области обработки аудиоданных не требуется. Если вам нужно подтянуть свое понимание трансформеров, ознакомьтесь с
нашим [курсом по NLP](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1) that goes into much detail on the transformer basics.

## Знакомство с командой курса

**Санчит Ганди, инженер-исследователь в области машинного обучения в Hugging Face**

Hi! I'm Sanchit and I'm a machine learning research engineer for audio in the open-source team at Hugging Face 🤗.
My primary focus is automatic speech recognition and translation, with the current goal of making speech models faster,
lighter and easier to use.

**Matthijs Hollemans, Machine Learning Engineer at Hugging Face**

I'm Matthijs, and I'm a machine learning engineer for audio in the open source team at Hugging Face. I'm also the author 
of a book on how to write sound synthesizers, and I create audio plug-ins in my spare time.

**Maria Khalusova, Documentation & Courses at Hugging Face**

I'm Maria, and I create educational content and documentation to make Transformers and other open-source tools even more 
accessible. I break down complex technical concepts and help folks get started with cutting-edge technologies.

**Vaibhav Srivastav, ML Developer Advocate Engineer at Hugging Face**

I'm Vaibhav (VB) and I'm a Developer Advocate Engineer for Audio in the Open Source team at Hugging Face. I research 
low-resource Text to Speech and help bring SoTA speech research to the masses.

## Course structure

The course is structured into several units that covers various topics in depth:

* [Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter1): learn about the specifics of working with audio data, including audio processing techniques and data preparation.
* [Unit 2](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter2): get to know audio applications and learn how to use 🤗 Transformers pipelines for different tasks, such as
audio classification and speech recognition.
* [Unit 3](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter3): explore audio transformer architectures, learn how they differ, and what tasks they are best suited for.
* [Unit 4](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter4): learn how to build your own music genre classifier.
* [Unit 5](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter5): delve into speech recognition and build a model to transcribe meeting recordings.
* [Unit 6](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter6): learn how to generate speech from text.
* [Unit 7](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter7): learn how to build real-world audio applications with transformers.

Each unit includes a theoretical component, where you will gain a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and
techniques. Throughout the course, we provide quizzes to help you test your knowledge and reinforce your learning.
Some chapters also include hands-on exercises, where you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned.

By the end of the course, you will have a strong foundation in using transformers for audio data and will be
well-equipped to apply these techniques to a wide range of audio-related tasks.

The course units will be released in several consecutive blocks with the following publishing schedule:

| Units   | Publishing date |
|---|-----------------|
| Unit 0, Unit 1, and Unit 2  | June 14, 2023   |
| Unit 3, Unit 4  | June 21, 2023   |
| Unit 5  | June 28, 2023   |
| Unit 6  | July 5, 2023    |
| Unit 7, Unit 8  | July 12, 2023   |

## Learning paths and certification

There is no right or wrong way to take this course. All the materials in this course are 100% free, public and open-source.
You can take the course at your own pace, however, we recommend going through the units in their order.

If you'd like to get certified upon the course completion, we offer two options:

| Certificate type   | Requirements                                                                                   |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Certificate of completion  | Complete 80% of the hands-on exercises according to instructions before September 1st 2023.    |
| Certificate of honors  | Complete 100% of the hands-on exercises according to instructions before September 1st 2023. |

Each hands-on exercise outlines its completion criteria. Once you have completed enough hands-on exercises to qualify
for either of the certificates, refer to the last unit of the course to learn how you can get your certificate. Good luck!

## Sign up to the course

The units of this course will be released gradually over the course of a few weeks. We encourage you to sign up to the
course updates so that you don't miss new units when they are released. Learners who sign up to the course updates will
also be the first ones to learn about special social events that we plan to host.
