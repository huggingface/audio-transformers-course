## What is Discord?

Discord is a free chat platform. If you've used Slack, you'll find it quite similar. The Hugging Face Discord server
is a home to a thriving community of 18 000 AI experts, learners and enthusiasts that you can be a part of.

## Navigating Discord

Once you sign up to our Discord server, you'll need to pick the topics you're interested in by clicking `#role-assignment`
at the left. You can choose as many different categories as you like. To join other learners of this course, make sure
to click "ML for Audio and Speech".
Explore the channels and share a few things about you in the `#introduce-yourself` channel.

## Audio course channels

There are many channels focused on various topics on our Discord server. You'll find people discussing papers, organizing
events, sharing their projects and ideas, brainstorming, and so much more.

As an audio course learner, you may find the following set of channels particularly relevant:

* `#audio-announcements`: updates about the course, news from the Hugging Face related to everything audio, event announcements, and more.
* `#audio-study-group`: a place to exchange ideas, ask questions about the course and start discussions.
* `#audio-discuss`: a general place to have discussions about things related to audio.

In addition to joining the `#audio-study-group`, feel free to create your own study group, learning together is always easier!
