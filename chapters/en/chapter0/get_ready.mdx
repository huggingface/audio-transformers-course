## Step 2. Get a Hugging Face account

receive your certificate of completion, to explore pre-trained models, to access datasets and more.

## Step 3. Brush up on fundamentals (if you need to)

We assume that you are familiar with deep learning basics, and have general familiarity with transformers. If you need
to brush up on your understanding of transformers, check out our [NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1).

## Step 4. Check your setup

To go through the course materials you will need:
- A computer with an internet connection
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for hands-on exercises. The free version is enough.

If you have never used Google Colab before, check out this [official introduction notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
