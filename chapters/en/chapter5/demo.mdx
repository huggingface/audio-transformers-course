# Build a demo with Gradio

Now that we've fine-tuned a Whisper model for Dhivehi speech recognition, let's go ahead and build a [Gradio]((https://gradio.app))
demo to showcase it to the community!

The first thing to do is load up the fine-tuned checkpoint using the `pipeline()` class - this is very familiar now from 
the section on [pre-trained models](asr_models.mdx). You can change the `model_id` to the namespace of your fine-tuned 
model on the Hugging Face Hub, or one of the pre-trained [Whisper models](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=openai%2Fwhisper-) 
to perform zero-shot speech recognition:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

model_id = "sanchit-gandhi/whisper-small-dv"  # update with your model id
pipe = pipeline("automatic-speech-recognition", model=model_id)
```

Secondly, we'll define a function that takes the filepath for an audio input and passes it through the pipeline. Here,
the pipeline automatically takes care of loading the audio file, resampling it to the correct sampling rate, and running
inference with the model. We can then simply return the transcribed text as the output of the function. To ensure our 
model can handle audio inputs of arbitrary length, we'll enable *chunking* as described in the section 
on [pre-trained models](asr_models.mdx):

```python
def transcribe_speech(filepath):
    output = pipe(
        filepath,
        max_new_tokens=256,
        generate_kwargs={
            "task": "transcribe",
            "language": "sinhalese",
        },  # update with the language you've fine-tuned on
        chunk_length_s=30,
        batch_size=8,
    )
    return output["text"]
```

We'll use the Gradio [blocks](https://gradio.app/docs/#blocks) feature to launch two tabs on our demo: one for microphone
transcription, and the other for file upload.

```python
import gradio as gr

demo = gr.Blocks()

mic_transcribe = gr.Interface(
    fn=transcribe_speech,
    inputs=gr.Audio(source="microphone", type="filepath"),
    outputs=gr.outputs.Textbox(),
)

file_transcribe = gr.Interface(
    fn=transcribe_speech,
    inputs=gr.Audio(source="upload", type="filepath"),
    outputs=gr.outputs.Textbox(),
)
```

Finally, we launch the Gradio demo using the two blocks that we've just defined:

```python
with demo:
    gr.TabbedInterface(
        [mic_transcribe, file_transcribe],
        ["Transcribe Microphone", "Transcribe Audio File"],
    )

demo.launch(debug=True)
```

This will launch a Gradio demo similar to the one running on the Hugging Face Space:

Should you wish to host your demo on the Hugging Face Hub, you can use this Space as a template for your fine-tuned model.

Click the link to duplicate the template demo to your account: https://huggingface.co/spaces/course-demos/whisper-small?duplicate=true

We recommend giving your space a similar name to your fine-tuned model (e.g. whisper-small-dv-demo) and setting the visibility to "Public".

Once you've duplicated the Space to your account, click "Files and versions" -> "app.py" -> "edit". Then change the
model identifier to your fine-tuned model (line 6). Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Commit changes to main".
he demo will reboot, this time using your fine-tuned model. You can share this demo with your friends and family so that 
they can use the model that you've trained!

We look forward to seeing your demos on the Hub!
