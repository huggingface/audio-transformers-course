# Evaluating text-to-speech models

During the training time, text-to-speech models optimize for the mean-square error loss (or mean absolute error) between 
the predicted spectrogram values and the generated ones. Both MSE and MAE encourage the model to minimize the difference 
between the predicted and target spectrograms. However, evaluation of the resulting text-to-speech (TTS) models is much 
more difficult. 

Unlike many other computational tasks that can be objectively 
measured using quantitative metrics, such as accuracy or precision, evaluating TTS relies heavily on subjective human analysis.

One of the most commonly employed evaluation methods for TTS systems is conducting qualitative assessments using mean 
opinion scores (MOS). MOS is a subjective scoring system that allows human evaluators to rate the perceived quality of 
synthesized speech on a scale from 1 to 5. These scores are typically gathered through listening tests, where human 
participants listen to and rate the synthesized speech samples.

One of the main reasons why objective metrics are challenging to develop for TTS evaluation is the subjective nature of 
speech perception. Human listeners have diverse preferences and sensitivities to various aspects of speech, including 
pronunciation, intonation, naturalness, and clarity. Capturing these perceptual nuances with a single numerical value 
is a daunting task. At the same time, the subjectivity of the human evaluation makes it challenging to compare and 
benchmark different TTS systems.

Furthermore, this kind of evaluation may overlook certain important aspects of speech synthesis, such as naturalness, 
expressiveness, and emotional impact. These qualities are difficult to quantify objectively but are highly relevant in 
applications where the synthesized speech needs to convey human-like qualities and evoke appropriate emotional responses.

In summary, evaluating text-to-speech models is a complex task due to the absence of objective metrics. The most common 
evaluation method, mean opinion scores (MOS), relies on subjective human analysis. While MOS provides valuable insights 
into the quality of synthesized speech, it also introduces variability and subjectivity.
