# Congratulazioni!

You have worked hard to reach this point, and we'd like to congratulate you on completing this Audio course!

Throughout this course, you gained foundational understanding of audio data, explored new concepts, and developed 
practical skills working with Audio Transformers.

From the basics of working with audio data and pre-trained checkpoints via pipelines, to building real-world 
audio applications, you have discovered how you can build systems that can not only understand sound but also create it. 

As this field is dynamic and ever-evolving, we encourage you to stay curious and continuously explore new models, research 
advancements, and new applications. When building your own new and exciting audio applications, make sure to always keep 
ethical implications in mind, and carefully consider the potential impact on individuals and society as a whole.

Thank you for joining this audio course, we hope you thoroughly enjoyed this educational experience, as 
much as we relished crafting it. Your feedback and contributions are welcome in 
the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/huggingface/audio-transformers-course).  

To learn how you can obtain your well-deserved certificate of completion, if you successfully passed the hands-on assignments,
